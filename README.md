## About Me

Can someone please define intelligence for me so that I can make an artificial version to make up for what I lack? Hi! I'm Rohin and I'm interested in everything and anything AI! Super curious and a bit cautious of where we are headed with the rapid progress in the field. I love to talk to people from all walks of life about their perspectives on AI.

If you're tired of reading "AI", you're not alone, let's talk about football ("soccer") instead!
